## Questions - Development Operations

1. What is DevOps?
    * DevOps is a set of practices that combine software development and IT operations. It aims
    to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software
    quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from
    Agile methodology.
    
2. Why DevOps:
    * DevOps-oriented engineers live at the intersection of IT operations and software development – 
    understanding much of what it takes to maintain IT infrastructure while also being able to write code 
    and deploy new services. DevOps-minded teams not only create services – but they also maintain them.
    
    * A DevOps structure forces teams to take accountability for their applications and infrastructure instead of 
    allowing developers to throw code over the proverbial wall to IT operations.

    * **3 Challenges**
        * It is difficult to acquire a DevOps engineer as they are a specialist role and require 1 to 4 years experience.
        This makes the DevOps position one of the most difficult jobs to fill.
        * DevOps is more of a culture and way-of-life in business, it is quite a difficult position to fill as previously mentioned,
        the person needs to be well-versed in a wide range of software and technologies.
        * Transition challenges, both technical and organisational. Dealing with legacy systems and re-building your 
        applications to implement microservices architecture or moving them to the cloud is probably what stops most businesses 
        from adopting DevOps. In addition to adding your product you might need to rebuild you team and change internal
        processes to fit the DevOps model. This includes changing team roles, hiring new members, adopting new tools, etc.
